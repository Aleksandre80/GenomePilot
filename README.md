Introduction
This project was developed for the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) of Amiens for bioinformatics analysis of sequencing data from Nanopore and Illumina technologies. This automated pipeline handles and analyzes genomic data, including DNA sequencing, modified base calling, demultiplexing, alignment, and other critical steps.

If there is enough interest, this pipeline could be made more public and flexible for use by other researchers, labs, or companies interested in genomic sequencing data processing.
